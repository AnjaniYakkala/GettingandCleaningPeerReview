This code book contains list of variables picked from the original dataset. 
These variables have the word mean or std, hence this list is smaller than the original.

There are total 81 variables in the dataset. Each of them described below:


1	Subject - the id of the person the data was collected
2	Activity - it is one of the activities performed by the subject. The activities are described in the 
README.md.


The below 79 variables below are the mean of velocities and accelerations collected  
for each subject using Samsung smartphone.
